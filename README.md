# Lambda Playground

A lambda calculus step reducer to help learn lambda calculus. Often, many of the higher-level constructs around lambda calculus (such as Church numerals or the Y-Combinator) are difficult to visualize unless you do the step beta reduction to see how the functions work. Too help, this project will allow the user to use multiple reduction strategies to visualize how these higher-level constructs work.
